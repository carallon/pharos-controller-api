``POST /api/scene``


.. only:: designer

  Payload is a JSON object with the following attributes:

  .. list-table::
    :widths: 3 3 10 5
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Attribute
      - Value Type
      - Description
      - Value Example
    * - ``action``
      - string
      - The action to perform on the scene(s): ``start``, ``release``, ``toggle``
      - ``"start"``
    * - ``num``
      - integer
      - The number of the scene to perform the action on. If not present, the action will be applied to all scenes in the project; omitting this attribute is valid for ``release``.
      - ``1``
    * - ``fade``
      - number
      - Optional. The fade time to apply to a ``release`` action, in seconds, or the scene release that results from a ``toggle`` action. If not provided, the default release fade time will be used.
      - ``2.0``
    * - ``group``
      - string **or** integer
      - Optional. Scene group name or number. If name, prepend the name with ``!`` to apply the action to all groups *except* the specified group. This attribute is valid for a ``release`` action without a specified ``num``, meaning *release all scenes*.
      - ``"Group 1"``, ``"!Group 2"`` or ``3``

  For example, to start a scene 2, the request payload is:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "action": "start",
      "num": 2
    }

  To release scene 2 in 3.5 seconds, the request payload would be:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "action": "release",
      "num": 2,
      "fade": 3.5
    }

  To toggle scene 2, and release it in 2 seconds if it's already been started, the request payload would be:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "action": "toggle",
      "num": 2,
      "fade": 2.0
    }

  To release all scenes in 2 seconds, the request payload would be:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "action": "release",
      "fade": 2.0
    }

  To release all scenes except those in group B in 2 seconds, the request payload would be:

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "action": "release",
      "group": "!B",
      "fade": 2.0
    }

  GET
  ===

  Returns data about the scenes in the project and their state on the controller.

  ``GET /api/scene[?num=sceneNumbers]``

  ``num`` can be used to filter which scenes are returned and is expected to be either a single number or a string expressing the required scenes, e.g. ``"1,2,5-9"``.

  Returns a JSON object with a single ``scenes`` attribute, which has an array value. Each item in the array is a Scene object with the following attributes:
