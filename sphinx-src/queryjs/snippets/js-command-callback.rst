Functions in the JavaScript API that perform actions on the controller, e.g. ``start_timeline``, have an optional ``callback`` argument. This expects a function, which is called when a response to the underlying HTTP API request is received. Its argument, if non-null, is the response body. If the content type of the response was ``"application/json"`` then the argument will be an object - the result of parsing the body as JSON.
