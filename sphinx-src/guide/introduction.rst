|Vendor| controllers offer :doc:`HTTP <../http-api/index>` and :doc:`Lua <../lua-api/index>` APIs providing access to system information, playback functions and trigger operations.

In addition, a small :doc:`JavaScript library <../queryjs/index>` is hosted on the controller's web server, which wraps the HTTP requests of the web API and also provides a mechanism to subscribe to the controller's websocket channels via callbacks.
