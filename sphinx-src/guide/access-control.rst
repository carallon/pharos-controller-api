Web Access Control
##################

If you are developing a custom web interface, you may want to restrict access to certain parts of it.

Access can be restricted using a :ref:`webconfig file<webconfig>`.

Historically, access was restricted using an :ref:`htaccess file<htaccess>`, however this method is deprecated and should not be used for new projects.
